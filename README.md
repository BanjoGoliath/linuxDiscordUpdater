# LinuxDiscordUpdater
Simple Python script that automatically downloads and installs the latest Discord update.

For a while now, updating Discord on Linux has been a pain (probably closer to mild inconvenience) because you need to manually install the update, unlike Windows.
This fixes that.

The included bash file sets up a venv, installs requirements and runs the script for you. It **MUST** be run with superuser privileges.
